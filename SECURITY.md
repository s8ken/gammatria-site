## Reporting a Vulnerability

The SYMBI ecosystem takes security seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose security vulnerabilities.

### How to Report

**Please do NOT report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report security vulnerabilities by emailing: **security@symbi.foundation**

Include the following information in your report:
- Type of issue (e.g., buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
- Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
- The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit it

### What to Expect

- **Acknowledgment**: We will acknowledge receipt of your vulnerability report within 48 hours
- **Initial Assessment**: We will provide an initial assessment within 5 business days
- **Regular Updates**: We will keep you informed of our progress throughout the investigation
- **Resolution Timeline**: We aim to resolve critical vulnerabilities within 30 days

### Responsible Disclosure

We ask that you:
- Give us reasonable time to investigate and fix the issue before public disclosure
- Avoid accessing, modifying, or deleting data belonging to others
- Do not perform actions that could harm the reliability or integrity of our services
- Do not use social engineering, physical, or electronic attacks against our employees, users, or infrastructure

### Recognition

We believe in recognizing security researchers who help keep our ecosystem safe:
- Public acknowledgment in our security advisories (if desired)
- Inclusion in our security researchers hall of fame
- Potential bounty rewards for significant vulnerabilities (case-by-case basis)

## Security Measures

### Current Protections

#### Application Security
- **Input Validation**: All user inputs are validated and sanitized
- **Authentication**: Secure authentication mechanisms where applicable
- **Authorization**: Proper access controls and permission checks
- **HTTPS**: All communications encrypted in transit

#### Infrastructure Security
- **Vercel Platform**: Leveraging Vercel's security infrastructure
- **Environment Variables**: Sensitive data stored securely
- **Dependency Scanning**: Regular dependency vulnerability scans
- **Code Analysis**: Static code analysis for security issues

#### Privacy Protection
- **Consent Management**: Explicit user consent for analytics
- **Data Minimization**: Collect only necessary data
- **GDPR Compliance**: Full compliance with privacy regulations
- **No Personal Data**: Analytics are anonymized and aggregated

### Security Best Practices

#### For Contributors
- Keep dependencies up to date
