# Economic Constitution

**TL;DR:** Open core; commercial attach; clear grant & audit lanes.

## Public-Purpose & Red Lines

Our purpose is public: make human–AI collaboration measurably safer and more useful for everyone.

**We will not:**
- Sell governance power or introduce speculation into participation.
- Paywall the protocol, schemas, or verification tools.
- Hide safety incidents or governance decisions from the public record.
- Accept funding conditioned on content control, surveillance misuse, or exclusionary access.
- Ship changes without receipts, review, and a public timelock.

These guardrails require **supermajority** approval across both houses to amend and a **public 30-day comment** window.
