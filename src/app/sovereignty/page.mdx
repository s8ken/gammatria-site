# Sovereignty Without Speculation

**TL;DR:** Power here is **earned**, not purchased. You gain voice by doing verifiable work; operators are accountable by bond; all change is public and timelocked.

## What sovereignty means here

- **Non-transferable Governance Units (NTGs):** reputation you **earn** through receipts, reviews, and standards work.
- **Operator Integrity Bonds:** organizations that run SYMBI at scale commit funds that can be **slashed** for violations.
- **Bicameral safeguards:** proposals pass the **House of Work** (reputation-weighted) and a **Stewardship** review (constitution/budget/security), then wait out a **timelock**.

> We don’t sell tokens. We don’t trade governance. Participation is the only path to voice.

## NTGs — non-transferable governance units

NTGs reflect standing in the protocol, earned via **Trust Receipts** and **CIQ** outcomes, accepted peer reviews, and standards work. They cannot be bought, sold, or transferred.

### How you earn NTGs

| Contribution (evidence required)                   | Typical NTGs | Cooldown |
| ---                                                | ---:         | ---:     |
| Validated Trust Receipts from a replication        | 1–5          | 7 days   |
| Peer-review of a CIQ evaluation (accepted)         | 2–6          | 7 days   |
| Accepted improvement to schemas/adapters           | 3–8          | 14 days  |
| Ethics review participation (quorum met)           | 2–4          | 14 days  |

**Evidence:** link a receipt hash, PR/commit, or review record.

### Decay & fairness

- NTGs **decay** over time without activity (gentle slope).
- Conflicts of interest → **recusal required**.
- Bad-faith conduct → **revocation** after due process.

## Operator Integrity Bonds

Operators who host or sell managed SYMBI services post a **bond** (escrow or equivalent).

**Slashable events (examples):**
- Scope/consent violation confirmed by receipts
- Repeated failure to retain audit logs
- Deceptive capability claims or unsafe handling of PII

**Due process:** notification → 7-day representation → decision & appeal window → public register update.

## Bicameral governance in brief

- **House of Work (HoW):** reputation-weighted signaling; open to contributors.
- **House of Stewardship (HoS):** narrow veto on constitution, budget, and security.

**Flow:** proposal → HoW soft-vote → HoS review → timelock → execute.

**Amendments:** Constitutional changes require a **supermajority across both houses** and a **public comment window** before execution.

## Why no token sale?

- Avoids speculation and capture  
- Simplifies compliance and enterprise adoption  
- Keeps voice tied to work, not capital

> If introduced later, **$SYMBI** remains **governance-only**, with **no primary sale** and **no profit rights**; payments stay in **fiat/stablecoins**.

### Commercial firewall

Commercial spend funds work (SaaS, audits, managed instances); **governance remains reputation-based (NTGs)** — never purchased.
