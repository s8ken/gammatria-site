# Rebel with Receipts

The system didn’t fail because people didn’t care; it failed because outcomes weren’t measured and power wasn’t accountable.  
SYMBI’s bet: **relationships over raw computation** and **receipts over rhetoric**.

- **Everyone can verify.** Core protocol, schemas, and the /proof toggle are free.
- **Voice is earned.** Non-transferable governance units (NTGs) reflect real work—never money.
- **Power has brakes.** Bicameral review, timelocks, and public receipts for every decision.
- **Operators are accountable.** Integrity bonds and due process, in public.
- **No speculation.** No token sale; governance remains participation-only.

**If we ever drift, pull us back.** File an RFC, challenge a receipt, call us to the Open Call—then check the log to see what changed.
